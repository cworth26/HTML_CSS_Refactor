# Description:

I was given code and asked to refactor the code to make specific things work better when loading and also to update the tags to semantic html tags to describe in more detail the different sections on the page. 
I updated the code to include anchor tags for when navigating to certain areas on the page. I did it by adding in ID's and linking those ID's to hrefs. Mostly all updates were done in HTML. I used "a href" tags to be able to get the page to navigate to specific places on the page. I also added classes so that I could update the styles of the page for the user experience.
